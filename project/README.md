# Givenname Project
## Brief Overview:

The aim of my current project is to investigate the correspondence between sound and meaning in Mandarin Chinese first names. With the ever-growing body of studies on the naming of fictional characters, the investigation of sound symbolism on first names has been limited thus far. The vast majority of these studies have focused on personal names in English (Cassidy et al., 1999; Cutler et al., 2017; Pitcher et al., 2013a; Sidhu & Pexman, 2015; Slater & Feinman, 1985; Sutton, 2016; Wright et al., 2005). Namely, these studies have reported vowels associated with smallness were more commonly found in female names (e.g. front vowels like /i/, /e/, and /aɪ/). On the contrary, male names were likely to contain vowels that are associated with largess (e.g. back vowels like/ æ/, /o/, and /eɪ/). These preferences have been proposed to reflect biological dimorphism where body-size preference guides gender-name assignment (Pitcher et al., 2013b; Sidhu & Pexman, 2015; Slater & Feinman, 1985). Although some studies have gone beyond Indo-European languages, the interaction between tones and segmental information remains unexplored (Urdu: Moshin & Kang, 2018, Mandarin: van de Weijer et al., 2020, and Cantonese: Wong & Kang, 2019). Of interest is whether these generalizations applied to Mandarin Chinese single vowels and how sound-gender associations interact with suprasegmental features (tones).  

## Procedure 
All name entries were first transcribed to IPA using the Epitran library tool (https://github.com/dmort27/epitran). Entries were then coded based on their phonological features. The details on vowel and tonal coding are elaborated below. Diphthongs and triphthongs are beyond the scope of investigation and thus discarded. This resulted in 24% of the data discarded (diphthongs: 541/21%; triphthongs: 74/3%). For any given character, male name gender bias was calculated by the proportions of male adoption over the total number of adoptions (N.male)/ (N.male + N.female), and vice versa for female name gender bias. Therefore, regression results would closely mirror one another since value of female gender bias could be derived from subtracting male gender bias from one (1 - male gender bias). Only male gender bias was inputted as the dependent variable below. Multiple regression was conducted to explore the correlation between phonological features and character gender biases.  

##  Vowels
Table 1 summarizes the inventory of Mandarin Chinese monophthong vowels and their corresponding classifications (Lee & Zee, 2003). Three factors of interest are vowel height (high, middle, and low), backness (front, center, and back), and rounding (rounded and unrounded).

Middle	e		ə		o
Low			a		


Vowel height and backness were predicted to be associated with name gender adoption (Cutler et al., 1990; Pitcher et al., 2013; van de Weijer et al., 2020; Wong & Kang, 2019). Studies have found that naming preference follows Frequency Codes across languages (Ohala, 1984, 1994). Of which, higher frequency produced by smaller vocalizers, is associated with females. On the contrary, lower frequency, which is typically produced by larger vocal apparatus, is considered male-like. For human vocalisations, vowel height is inversely related to the first formant (F1) while vowel backness correlates with the second formant (F2). This translates to high fronted vowels with higher frequency are associated with females. Whereas low and backed vowels with lower frequency are associated with males. Although lip rounding has been found to lower F2 formant, it was not found to interact with gender sound symbolism in past Mandarin studies (van de Weijer et al., 2020). Thus, there are no reasons to anticipate results contrary to previous investigations in Mandarin Chinese.  
However, it should be noted that vowel height and backness are partially confounded in Mandarin Chinese (Cutler et al., 1990; Duanmu, 2007). The co-occurrence of restriction and collinearity amongst vowel backness and height are unavoidable. Future studies should consider taking these factors into consideration.  

##  Tones
Table 2 summarizes the tonal inventory of Mandarin Chinese. Unlike many Indo-European languages, pitch variations are used to convey word meaning (Lin, 2012). Novelty of this study is the investigation of tones in first name gender association. Even though van de Weijer et al. (2020) tabulated the distribution of tones across genders, no statistical test was conducted. Conclusions were driven by eye-ball comparisons.  
High and low tones were expected to be associated with gender adoption. Tonal distribution is expected to align with Frequency Code hypothesis (Ohala, 1984, 1994). High tones were expected to favour female names; low tones were anticipated to associate with male names.

##  Results and Discussion
Multiple regression was used to examine whether vowel and tonal features predicted name gender biases. The fitted model contained only intercept and fit improving predictors. Results of regression indicated that seven predictors accounted for 5.3% of the variance (F(6,1847)=18.24, p <.001, R2 =  .056, R2Adjusted = .053). Only predictors that reached statistical significance were discussed below. Namely, high vowels significantly predicted female gender adoption (β = -0.0541, p < .000). For middle vowel, it significantly predicted male gender adoption (β = 0.0550, p < .000). Additionally, rounded vowels significantly predicted female gender adoption (β = -0.0393, p <0.029). For tonal features, low tones significantly predicted male gender adoption (β =0.2181, p <0.042).  

Somewhat unexpectedly, vowel and tonal features only accounted for 5% of the variance. This could possibly be attributed to characters and syllable position playing a substantial role in name gender biases. Phonology has been suspected to play a minimal role in character recognition. Because of its simple syllabic structure, there are only 400 possible unique syllables excluding lexical tone, or 1300 syllables with tones included (Duanmu, 2007). These syllables were then mapped onto 5000 characters of various meanings, which translated to many homophones. As a result, logographs have been suspected to play a greater role in Mandarin Chinese. The choice of male or female names might rely on the visual makeup of characters, rather than its sounds. Besides, syllable position has been reported to play a role in gender biasing (Wong & Kang, 2019; Wright et al., 2005). Future research should consider incorporating syllable position into their analysis.  

Unlike previous studies in English, a backness effect was not attested. This is possibly due to the small inventory of vowels in Mandarin Chinese. Moreover, it has been reported that lip rounding reduces the F2 contrast between front and back vowel (Wong & Kang, 2019). This weakens the underpinnings of frequency-based gender name biases.  
Interestingly, a tonal effect was attested. Low melody tones (tone 3 and tone 4) were found to predict gender adoption. This stands in contrast to previous investigation on tone-meaning connection in Mandarin Chinese. Critically, van de Weijer et al. (2020) did not find an effect of the tonal category on gender adoption. The lack of observed effect could be caused by a small sample.  

Results were in-line with Frequency codes. Higher frequencies are indeed predicted female name adoption while low frequencies predicted male name adoption. This study contributes to the growing literature on first name sound symbolism. We hope that this study builds towards the on-going trend of moving beyond English in examining first name sound symbolism.
